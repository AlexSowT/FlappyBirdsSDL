# Flappy Birds SDL Clone
## Introduction
This is a project I have made to learn the basics of creating a 2-D SDL game. 
Ideas I have practised with: 
- Rendering a texture to the screen
- Simple event handling
- Text renderign using SDL_ttf
- Playing music and sound effects using SDL_mixer
- Creating a basic layer system to keep the game loop tidier.

## Could be improved
_(I likely will not do this as the point of this exercise was to practise some basic ideas)_
- Improved Title Screen
- High score system
- Increasing difficulty
- Fix bugs such as background tearing and being able to fly over/under the pipes
